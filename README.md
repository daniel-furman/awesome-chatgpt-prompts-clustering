## Goal

Segment common items in a text dataset to pinpoint core themes and their distribution. 

* Clusters cover the main topics/subtopics in the dataset
* Clusters backed by [gpt-3.5-turbo-16k](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) generated summaries

## Background

We employ [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for probabilistic clustering. This algorithm is advantageous in many ways, including:

* Don’t be wrong: Cluster can have varying densities, don’t need to be globular, and won’t include noise
* Intuitive parameters: Choosing a minimum cluster size is very reasonable, and the number of *k* clusters does not need to be specified (HDBSCAN finds the optimal *k* for you)
* Stability: HDBSCAN is stable over runs and subsampling and has good stability over parameter choices
* Performance: When implemented well HDBSCAN can be very efficient; the current implementation has similar performance to fastcluster’s agglomerative clustering

See the HDBSCAN docs on [comparing clustering algorithms](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparing_clustering_algorithms.html#hdbscan) and [how hdbscan works](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html) for more information.

**Figure 1**. HDBSCAN splits the data into three segments, "cluster 0" with 44 prompts (orange), "cluster 1" with 105 prompts (blue), and "outliers" with 4 prompts (gray).

![](experiments/02_09_2023_16_54_32/assets/exemplars_viz_1.png)

**Figure 2**. The most persistent prompts in each leaf cluster are known as "exemplars". These represent the hearts around which the ultimate cluster formed. See the HDBSCAN docs on [soft clustering explanation](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/soft_clustering_explanation.html#distance-based-membership) for supporting information and functions.

**Figure 3**. Additional clustering is conducted around the exemplars to identify sub-topics in the dataset. The cases in each sub-cluster then serve as context for the [gpt-3.5-turbo-16k](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) calls below.

HDBSCAN splits the stable diffusion prompts at hand into several dozens of clusters, with 48699 (66%) binned as outliers and 25019 (33%) grouped into 78 clusters. The 25 largest clusters cover 20.6% of the dataset - these are the themes we will examine for drift in this experiment.

**Figure 5**. A visualization of 5 sample themes from the dataset. The summaries were generated by [claude-2](https://claude.ai/chats). The above was created with [jsoncrack.com/editor](https://jsoncrack.com/editor).
