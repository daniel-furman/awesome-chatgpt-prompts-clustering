## Goals

1. Segment common items in a given text dataset to pinpoint its core themes and their overall coverage. 
    * Clusters should cover the main topics/subtopics within the dataset. 
    * Clusters should map comprehensively to the raw data and be illustrated by helpful summaries.
2. The implemenation should be reproducible, easy to extend to new datasets, and automated from start to finish.

## Background

We employ [`HDBSCAN`](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to probabilistically segment text into clusters. This algorithm is advantageous in many ways, including:

1. Don’t be wrong: Cluster can have varying densities, don’t need to be globular, and won’t include noise
2. Intuitive parameters: Choosing a minimum cluster size is very reasonable, and the number of *k* clusters does not need to be specified (HDBSCAN finds the optimal *k* for you)
3. Stability: HDBSCAN is stable over runs and subsampling and has good stability over parameter choices
4. Performance: When implemented well HDBSCAN can be very efficient; the current implementation has similar performance to fastcluster’s agglomerative clustering

### Exemplars

**Figure 2**. The most persistent prompts in each leaf cluster are known as "exemplars". These represent the hearts around which the ultimate cluster formed.

### Sub-Clustering

**Figure 3**. Additional clustering is conducted around the exemplars to identify sub-topics in the dataset. The cases in each sub-cluster then serve as context for the [`gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) calls below.
